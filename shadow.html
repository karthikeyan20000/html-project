  <h1> The elephant is one among a few animals that use tools in their day-to-day lives. A few examples of such animals are discussed. A species of vulture uses a stone to break ostrich eggs. Some otters found in the Californian seas, use a stone to break open clam shells. A woodpecker sometimes uses a stick to stir insects hiding in a hole. Monkeys use a blade of grass to draw out ants from a hole. An elephant uses a twig to scratch itself and can learn to manipulate a variety of objects, to carry out a variety of activities.
    Elephants love spending lots of time in the water and can swim long distances. They also love wallowing in the marsh.
    Elephants travel extensively, walking long distances in the wild, in search of food, shade, minerals and water. Since they have an enormous food requirement, they have to travel constantly to look for fodder sources. They do not stay confined to a single place for a long time which avoids habitat destruction.
    They walk at a slow pace of 4km/hr. Elephant walk has been made into a music, (in the film Hatari) which is popular all over the world.
    Elephants feed on all three tiers of plant life i.e., lower (grass), middle (bush), and upper (canopy) tiers.
    Elephants have very clean feeding habits. While grazing, they pull out a bunch of grass and dust the mud and dirt against their legs before eating it.
    Elephants drink 200-255 litres of water a day. I.e., 50-60 litres at a time, 3-4 times a day. A trunkful can retain 6-7 litres or even as much as 10 litres.
    Elephants can run short distances quite quickly (25 Km/hr for short distances), or 30-40 kms/hr, according to reports from Mudumalai Elephant Camp, in Tamil Nadu. Even with hobbles they can hop very fast, but cannot gallop like horses or run like cattle.
    In Kerala, there is a misconception that, elephants fan their ears because they appreciate the rhythm of the Panchavadyam, a musical symphony. Although it makes a nice story, this is not true. Elephants fan their ears, to cool their body. Sweating, in other species such as man, helps maintain suitable body temperature. Since elephants have few sweat glands, they depend on their ears to regulate their body temperature. The ear is an important organ in removing heat. The blood from the various parts of the body is transported to the ear where they are cooled due to its fanning motion. This cooled blood, then flows back into the various parts of the body, thus bringing down the body temperature. It is observed that there is a difference of 1 degree centigrade in the temperature, of arterial and venous blood of the ear.
    Most animals, fold their hind limbs backwards, while lying down, but elephants fold them forwards.
    Elephants cannot jump up, because their legs are not shaped correctly, for absorbing the shock of a jump. They may leap horizontally however, as their knee cap is placed very low, which helps them stand on or bend their knees, like humans.
    Mating consists of prolonged courting , short duration of penetration, several times a day.
    Elephants can stand for long periods. Horses and passerine birds have checked ligaments, which help them to stand, while sleeping straight up. Similarly, elephants are also provided with such feet, that can be splayed, thus enabling them to stand for long periods. There was an elephant in Thrippunithara, Kerala, that stood up for 18 months, when it was sick. Healthy elephants in captivity, usually do not lie down during the day.
    Elephants are efficient seed dispersers. Seeds that pass out in the elephant's dung are highly viable and germinate easily.
    They defecate 15-20 times a day. The number of boli being 5-8 and weighing 1-21/2 kg. Elephants urinate 10-15 times a day and a total quantity of 50-60 litres is expelled. Inadequate water intake produce crystelluria.
    Elephants can unerringly locate and dig out water from the subsoil or river beds, during the dry periods.
    Elephants have a remarkable memory for events and people and are also believed to be emotional. While in musth, captive male elephants deliberately try to attack their mahouts.
    Elephants are gregarious by nature. In the wild when a baby elephant is born, it is trained and disciplined by every adult in the group. Captive born calves, on the other hand, turn out to be truants, as they are excessively pampered by humans. They turn out to be problematic adults, if not trained properly after weaning.
    African elephants have matriarchal groups and the leader of a herd is usually a cow-elephant, this is not certain to occur in Asian Elephants.
    Males are loosely attached to the herd. In summer, when there is scarcity of food and water, the herds break up into smaller herds and when favourable conditions return , they re-unite to form a large herd with a larger number of individuals.
    Elephants in the wild spend a minimum of 60-70% of their activity in feeding.
    In summer during the day, the herds spend 2-4 hours a day resting, to prevent heat strokes.
    Elephant herds when threatened, have an interesting defence strategy. At first they all stand in a line defending. Then they round up the young ones and sub-adults into the centre and form a circle around them.
    Elephants can never be completely domesticated. They always have a desire to return to the wild, unlike some other domesticated species, such as dogs and cats, which come back home.
